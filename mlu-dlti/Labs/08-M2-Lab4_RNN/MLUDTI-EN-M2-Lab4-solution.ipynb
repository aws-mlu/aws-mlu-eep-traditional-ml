With this dataset, you will use RNNs on the __reviewText__ field. You will assume that the text is made of words or tokens that are placed in a grammatically logical order. The RNN will understand the associations between the words through the recurrent connections. Eventually, it will learn to classify the text correctly (up to a certain accuracy level). \n",
